# ChatBot

```




 I building a chatbot that can carry out conversations with users using natural language processing.

To start,I will be using Microsoft DialoGPT, a pre-trained language model that can generate human-like responses to given prompts.I integrated DialoGPT with Flask, a popular Python web framework, to create a web application that can communicate with users via a chat interface.

For the frontend of our application, I have  useed HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a visually appealing and interactive chat interface. Additionally,I used using jQuery to handle the HTTP requests that are made to the backend server.

 I  and create the required files and code for the application.

By the end of this Project, I will have a fully functional chatbot that can engage in conversations with users, and you will have gained valuable experience in using Microsoft DialoGPT, Flask, and web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
